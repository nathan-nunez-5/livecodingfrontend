Feel free to solve this problem with any method (using just the pbe window, the live code window or a combination of the two)

Write a function that takes in strings and concatenates their 5th characters,
if a string doesn't have an 5th character concatenate a space instead.

f("hello") = "o"
f("1") = " "
