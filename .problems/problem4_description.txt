Feel free to solve this problem with any method (using just the pbe window, the live code window or a combination of the two)

Write a function that takes in 2 strings and concatenates their 5th characters,
if a string doesn't have an 5th character concatenate a space instead.

first example: f("hello", "world") = "od"

second example: f("1", "what") = "  "
