Feel free to solve this problem with any method (using just the pbe window, the live code window or a combination of the two)

Write a function that takes in 2 strings and concatenates their 5th characters,
if a string doesn't have an 5th character concatenate a space instead.

f("what", "world") = " d"
f("a", "b") = "  "
