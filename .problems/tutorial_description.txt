We will be going over the two features of the LPI.

<h4><b>Programming Synthesis</b></h4>
To activate synthesis, try inputing one of the examples into the PBE window. There can only be one example per line, and in each the example must be formatted
as follows
</br>
f(input) =  output
</br>
Note that the examples must be formatted correctly in order for synthesis to work. Synthesis will activate once you click outside the window.

<h4><b>Programming Reevaluation</b></h3>
To activate reevaluation change the code within the Live Coding window. Changes will appear in real-time in the example window.
Try changing the double function to 2 more than its input
