The LPI has two modes of operation - synthesis and reevaluation.

<h4><b>Programming Synthesis</b></h4>
Using the LPI in synthesis mode will cause the system to automatically generate code according to your examples.
There can only be one example per line. For a function named foo, you must format the example as shown below:
</br>
foo(input) =  output
</br>
Note that the examples must be formatted correctly in order for synthesis to work. Synthesis will activate once you click outside the window or press enter.

Try inputting an example, as shown to right, to synthesize a fix to the implementation of the double function, so that the double function actually calculates twice the input.

<h4><b>Programming Reevaluation</b></h3>
Using the LPI reevaluation mode will cause the system to automatically update examples according to code.
To try this, change the code within the Live Coding window when you have some examples in the PBE Window.
Changes will then appear in real-time in the PBE Window.
Try changing the double function to do something else.
